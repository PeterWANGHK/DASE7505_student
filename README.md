# Lab - Closed loop control of mobile robots
## Introduction
After this lab students should be able to …

- Explain the concept of feedback and the role of a controller in a closed-loop robotic system.
- Implement and tune basic controllers ( P, PD, PI, PID ) in Python nodes under ROS 2.
- Use /odom feedback to compute pose error and generate /cmd_vel commands.
- Understand the architecture of multi-node control systems (decision → localization → controller).
- Evaluate controller performance using plots of pose / velocity / error.

## Submission - Lab Report
Please prepare a written report in pdf format containing personal details in the front page:
- Names (Family Name, First Name)
- UID

report the following:
- Your filled-in python codes with explanations (i.e., how performances change after adjusting parameters?)
- A brief discussion to show your understanding of the closed loop control. Hint: you may leverage on the course material and the online documentation of the messages to better interpret your data.
## There are no minimum page limit or format requirements, but a more professional report could contribute to a higher mark for this lab exercise.
## Deadline: check the announcements in HKU Moodle.
