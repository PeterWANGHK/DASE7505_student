# ROS Setup

Install ROS2

Download the script (or if you installed git, clone this repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PeterWANGHK/DASE7505_student.git
```
then change the branch to setup with 
```bash
git checkout setup
```
Run the script to install the relevant packages for ROS development:
```bash
sh setup_dase7505.sh
```
that will take care of installing everything you need for this course. Be patient since it involves a lot of packages and you will see the page like this if everything is fine
